# Resume

This repository contains my résumé (cv2.pdf) and a small web page that lets people view or download it.

How to view:
- Web page (GitHub Pages): https://ChetanEpuri.github.io/Resume/
- Direct PDF (raw): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChetanEpuri/Resume/main/cv2.pdf

Notes:
- This repository is intended to be a general public copy of my résumé for sharing with recruiters, interviewers, and professional contacts.
- If you prefer a private share, consider storing the PDF in a private file-sharing service (OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox) or make the repo private and share access to specific people.
